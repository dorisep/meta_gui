# Meta_GUI
A gui to help develop a spotify playlist app, a music database and visualizations for an analtical dashboard
## Overview
---
I enjoyed working on this project as an exercise in broadening my foundation in python and app developement overall. I look forward to honing my skills through as I continue its developement.

## Background
---
I created two apps prior to developing this gui. 

- A web scrapping [app](https://github.com/dorisep/meta_gui/blob/main/apps/scrape.py) to track albums released each week
- An [api](https://github.com/dorisep/meta_gui/blob/main/apps/playlist_app.py) that creates a playlist on my Spotify account.

As a music enthusiast, I am always exploring new music. 

While many streaming services have playlists and access to new releasses, I grew tired of feeling bound to algorithyms and coallating my own playlists. 

What I really wanted was a raw dump of albums into a list that I could listen to and select from regardless of my listening history or derived preferences. 

That led to the aformentioned applications. Which also grew as I decided to flesh out my understanding of python and development overall.
